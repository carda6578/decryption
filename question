The enclosed files include:
1- a cipher text message (unknown_msg.dat) which is encrypted using a shift cipher with unknown shift. 
2- an Excel file with the histogram data for the three popular languages English, French and German. 
The historagm is generated using a sample text from each of these languages and shows the frequency of 
occurance of each letter from the sample text. We are assuming that the histograms are a fair representation 
of the frequency of occurance of letter in the language. 
3- chiper.h is also included that you can use to encrypt and decrypt the message. For decryption, use encrypt 
function with shift of (26-shift). You can also use a different decryption function of your choice. Make 
sure to submit the function you used for decryption.
Task:
Your task in this worksheet is to identify the language the original message was written in and the shift 
that was used to encrypt the message. Include the first paragraph of the decrypted message in your report.

Submit report (1 page max):
1- one page report containing
   a. histogram of unknown_msg.dat that you used to identify (match) a language histogram
   b. the matching language histogram
   c. encrypt function (if you used a different function)
   d. explain why you think the two histograms match
   e. what was the shift used to encrypt the message
   f. first paragraph from the unknown_msg.dat, decrypted.
